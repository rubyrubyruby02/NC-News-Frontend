# Ruby's Northcoder's News Frontend Project

Please find my hosted version [here](https://northcoders-news-by-ruby.netlify.app/)

## Project Summary
This is a front-end project using the React. I have created the app from scratch, added the components and used hooks such as useState, useEffect and useSearchParams.
Inside the Wireframe folder are my planning sketches. This was built as part of my time on the Northcoder's software development bootcamp.
